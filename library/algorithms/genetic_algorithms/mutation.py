def binary_standard_mutation(representation: str | list, mut_prob):
    """
    Applies standard binary mutation to a binary string or list representation.

    This function supports both binary strings (e.g., "10101") and binary lists 
    (e.g., [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]) containing either string characters ("0", "1") or 
    integers (0, 1). Each gene in the representation is independently flipped 
    with a given mutation probability, while preserving the original data type 
    of the genes.

    The function preserves the type of the input representation: if the input is 
    a string, the output will also be a string; if it's a list, the output will 
    remain a list.

    Parameters:
        representation (str or list): The binary representation to mutate.
        mut_prob (float): The probability of flipping each gene.

    Returns:
        str or list: A new mutated representation of the same type as the input.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input contains elements other than 0, 1, "0", or "1".

def swap_mutation(representation, mut_prob):
    """
    Applies swap mutation to a solution representation with a given probability.

    Swap mutation randomly selects two different positions (genes) in the 
    representation and swaps their values. This operator is commonly used for 
    permutation-based representations but works for any list or string.

    The function preserves the type of the input representation: if the input is 
    a string, the output will also be a string; if it's a list, the output will 
    remain a list.

    Parameters:
        representation (str or list): The solution to mutate.
        mut_prob (float): The probability of performing the swap mutation.

    Returns:
        str or list: A new solution with two genes swapped, of the same type as the input.
