"""Problem definition

Description: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is the challenge of finding the shortest possible route that starts in a given city, visits each of the remaining N-1 cities exactly once, and returns to the starting city.

Search space: All possible permutations of city visit orders, forming valid round-trip routes.

Representation: List of city indexes that compose the route

Fitness function: f(x)= Total distance traveled, computed as the sum of distances between consecutive cities in the route.

Neighbors: A neighbor solution is obtained by swapping the positions of two consecutive cities in the route.

Goal: Minimize f(x).
