"""Problem definition

Description: The Knapsack Problem involves selecting a subset of N items, each with a given value and weight, to pack into a container with a fixed capacity. If the total weight of selected items exceeds the capacity, the solution is invalid. The goal is to maximize the total value of items while ensuring they fit within the container's constraints.

Search space: All possible subsets of items that can be placed in the knapsack.

Representation: Binary string of length N (number of items), where 1 indicates the item is included in the knapsack and 0 indicates the item is excluded.

Fitness function: f(x)= Total value inside the knapsack. If the total size exceeds the knapsack's capacity, the solution is invalid and assigned a fitness of -inf.

Neighbors: A neighbor solution is obtained by flipping a single bit, meaning adding one item to the knapsack, or removing one item from the knapsack.

Goal: Maximize f(x).
